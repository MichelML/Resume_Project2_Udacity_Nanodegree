## What is this project?

This project was meant to be completed while being part of the Front-End developer Nanodegree at Udacity. Throughout the this project I have built my resume by writing a JS script that combine my personal information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate my resume.  
  
I also have made careful adjustments to the default design of the template that was given.  
  
I finally have created a gulp file to automate build tasks and to optimize my website before making it available online.

### What was learned from this project?

JavaScript syntax, which includes manipulating data types (like JSON), building loops and creating functions.  
jQuery DOM manipulation methods to build the website dynamically the moment a user opens it.
