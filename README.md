## What is this project?

This project was meant to be completed while being part of the Front-End developer Nanodegree at Udacity. Throughout this project I have built my resume by writing a JS script that combine my personal information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate my resume.  
  
I also have made careful adjustments to the default design of the template that was given.  
  
I finally have created a gulp file to automate build tasks and to optimize my website before making it available online.

### What was learned from this project?

1. JavaScript syntax
2. Manipulating data types (JSON)  
3. Perfecting my loops skills and function creation.  
4. AJAX requests
5. jQuery DOM manipulation
